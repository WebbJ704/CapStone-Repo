# Conclusion & Next Steps

## Summary
- We demonstrated two approaches to portfolio optimisation and compared their out‑of‑sample performance from 2024‑01‑01 onward.  
- Bootstrapping provided uncertainty bounds, improving the credibility of the findings.

## Recommendations
1. Add a second data source (risk‑free or macro) to contextualise performance.  
2. Introduce rolling/expanding window validation and transaction costs.  
3. Consider alternative models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Bayesian optimisation) and constraints (sector caps, max weight).

## Limitations
- Survivorship bias and limited asset universe.  
- Parameter sensitivity (look‑back window, resampling seed).  
- No transaction costs or slippage in current pipeline.

## Deliverables
- Executive Summary (this site).  
- Methods, Results, and Appendix pages with downloadable artefacts (figures, tables, code links).
