Portfolio Optimization with Random Forest and SciPy

This project is a quantitative finance pipeline for stock portfolio optimization. It combines data acquisition, statistical analysis, machine learning, and numerical optimization to identify portfolio weights that maximize performance metrics like the Sharpe ratio.

Features

Data Acquisition

Automatically fetches historical stock price data using yfinance.

Supports caching to CSV for faster repeated access.

Statistical Analysis

Computes daily and annualized returns for individual stocks.

Uses bootstrap simulations to estimate distributions of returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios.

Portfolio Simulation

Generates thousands of random portfolios and calculates their annualized returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios.

Visualizes risk vs. reward for various portfolio weight combinations.

Machine Learning Optimization

Uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict Sharpe ratios from simulated portfolio weights.

Identifies top-performing weight combinations with the trained model.

Numerical Optimization

Uses SciPyâ€™s minimize to find optimal portfolio weights that maximize the Sharpe ratio.

Supports constraints like weight bounds and minimum return requirements.

Visualization

Plots distributions of returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios from bootstrap simulations.

Visualizes cumulative returns of individual stocks and optimized portfolios.

Technologies & Libraries

Python 3

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn for Random Forest modeling

scipy.optimize for portfolio optimization

yfinance for historical stock data

tqdm for progress tracking

Typical Workflow

Fetch historical stock data for desired tickers.

Calculate daily returns and perform bootstrap analysis.

Simulate thousands of random portfolios and compute performance metrics.

Train a Random Forest model to predict Sharpe ratios from portfolio weights.

Optimize portfolio weights with SciPy for maximum Sharpe ratio.

Visualize results and cumulative returns.
