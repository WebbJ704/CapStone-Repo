# Executive Summary

**Project Title:** Portfolio Optimisation & Forecasting of US Tech Equities (2020â€“Present)  
**Author:** James Webb  
**Date:** September 2025  

## Problem & Motivation
Investors face the challenge of constructing portfolios that balance return and risk under uncertainty. Traditional meanâ€“variance optimisation is often unstable, leading to allocations that fail out of sample. This project applies both **machine learning** and **numerical optimisation** to build and evaluate portfolios of leading US technology equities (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMD).  

## Data & Methods
Daily adjusted close data was sourced from **Yahoo Finance** (via `yfinance`). Portfolios were evaluated using:  

- **Random Forest Regressor** trained on thousands of sampled weight vectors to predict Sharpe ratios and identify high-performing allocations.  
- **SLSQP Optimisation** (scipy) to directly maximise annualised Sharpe ratio with constraints (long-only, weights sum to 1).  
- **Bootstrapping** of returns to quantify uncertainty around performance metrics.  
- **Visualisation** of risk/return trade-offs and cumulative returns.  

## Key Results 
- **Random Forest**: Predicted test Sharpe of **[0.67]** with weights **[AAPL: 0.45, MSFT: 0.31, GOOGL: 0.01, AMD: 0.24]**.  
- **SLSQP**: Test Sharpe of **[0.64]** with weights **[AAPL: 0.50, MSFT: 0.26, GOOGL: 0.00, AMD: 0.24]** under a minimum return constraint of **[25%]**.  
- **Bootstrap Random Forest**: Mean Sharpe **[â€¦]**, 95% interval **[â€¦, â€¦]**.
- **Bootstrap SLSQP**: Mean Sharpe **[â€¦]**, 95% interval **[â€¦, â€¦]**. 
- **Cumulative Return Random Forest**: Portfolio achieved **[â€¦]%** vs equal-weight benchmark **[â€¦]%** in the test period.
- **Cumulative Return SLSQ**: Portfolio achieved **[â€¦]%** vs equal-weight benchmark **[â€¦]%** in the test period.  

## Implications
The combined machine learning and optimisation framework demonstrates how uncertainty-aware portfolio construction can outperform naive benchmarks. Beyond finance, this approach generalises to other FP&A contexts â€” such as product mix, pricing, and budget allocation â€” where trade-offs and uncertainty must be managed.  

## Next Steps
- Add risk-free/macro data to improve Sharpe calculation.  
- Incorporate transaction costs and rebalancing.  
- Extend to rolling/expanding validation for robustness.
